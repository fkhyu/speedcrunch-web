This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Desktop (Tauri)

```bash
# Dev: opens a native window and runs Next dev server automatically
npm run dev:desktop

# Build native installers/bundles
npm run build:desktop
```

- Requires Rust toolchain (`rustup`) and system prerequisites per Tauri docs.
- In dev, the window points to `http://localhost:3000`.
- In production build, it serves the static export from `out` generated by `next export`.
