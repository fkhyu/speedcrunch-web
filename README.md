# WebCrunch

A web-based scientific calculator inspired by SpeedCrunch, built with React, Tailwind, Vite, and Tauri.

## Features

- **Scientific Calculator** - Advanced mathematical functions and operations
- **Unit Support** - Comprehensive unit conversion and calculations
- **History** - Track your calculations with syntax highlighting
- **Desktop App** - Native desktop application via Tauri
- **Modern UI** - Clean, responsive interface with dark theme

## Getting Started

### Web Development

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Desktop Application (Tauri)

```bash
# Development: opens a native window and runs Vite dev server automatically
npm run dev:desktop

# Build native installers/bundles
npm run build:desktop
```

**Requirements:**
- Rust toolchain (`rustup`) and system prerequisites per [Tauri docs](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)
- In dev, the window points to `http://localhost:3000`
- In production build, it serves the static files from `dist` generated by `vite build`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run dev:desktop` - Tauri desktop development
- `npm run build:desktop` - Tauri desktop build
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Desktop**: Tauri (Rust)
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Math Engine**: Custom with decimal.js (based on Abicus Pratt-parser)
